The Australia Telescope Parkes Observatory
******************************************

Overview of the Parkes Observatory
==================================

The Parkes Observatory is located 414.80m above sea level at Latitude -32d 59m 54.263s South, Longitude 
148d 15m 48.636s East, 25 kilometers North of the town of Parkes which is approximately 365 kilometres West of Sydney.
It is 6 kilometres off the Newell Highway, the main road from Parkes to Dubbo. The Shire has a population of 
15,000 and the town a population of 10,000 and is in the middle of a rich sheep, wheat producing and mining area. The Observatory 
is part of `Australia Telescope National Facility <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/>`_ which is run by Astronomy and Space Science, 
a division of the `Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation <http://www.csiro.au>`_. The Parkes site 
contains the 64-metre RadioTelescope, the 12-metre ASKAP prototype antenna, an administration building with offices, workshops and library, 
Visitors Discovery Centre and The `Dish Cafe <http://www.dishcafe.com.au/>`_.

The collecting area of the telescope is a 64-m diameter paraboloid (the dish). The surface is high precision aluminium millimetre wavepanels to a
diameter of 17-m (for operation to 43 GHz), then perforated aluminium plate out to 45-m, and rectangular galvanised steel 5/16-inch mesh for
the remainder of the surface. The focal ratio is 0.41 for the full 64m surface, the focus being located 26-m above the centre. The aerial cabin,
which houses feeds and receiver equipment, is supported by a tripod. Access to the aerial cabin is either by the lift on one of the tripod
legs (the "lift leg") or by a ladder on one of the other legs. The feed platform translator, which can hold up to four receivers, at the base of the
aerial cabin has both up/down (focus), lateral and rotational movement. Further properties of the RadioTelescope are shown below.

- Weight of dish:                   300 tonnes
- Weight of counterweights:         475 tonnes
- Total weight of the dish:         1,000 tonnes
- Surface area of reflecting mesh:  0.4 hectares (1 acre)
- Height of concrete tower:         10.7 metres (35 ft)
- Height to centre of dish:         27.4 metres (90 ft)
- Height to top of aerial cabin:    58.6 metres (192 ft)
- Power of Azimuth/Zenith drives:   11 kW (15 hp)
- Pointing accuracy:	            Generally less than 20 arcsec
- Coverage:                         Az 0-360 deg., El 30.5-88.5 deg.


The dish may be operated between the Zenith angle software limits of 1.2
and 59.5 degrees. There are three hardware limits at Zenith angles less
than 1.5 degrees, and also another three past 59.5 degrees. The dish can
be "stowed" at a physical limit 30 minutes of arc beyond the Zenith. It
is constrained in this position by a locking pin. Azimuth angle is
measured as 0 degrees due north, increasing to the east.
